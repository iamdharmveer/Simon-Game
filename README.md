GamePlay:
The device has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or aactivated by the device. A round in the game consist of the device lighting up one or more buttons in random order with a meledous tone, now the player has to click the button in the same order. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.
Simon's tones, were designed to always be harmonic, no matter what order they were played in, and consisted of an A major triad in second inversion which resembles a Trumpet fanfare:
 * E-note (blue, lower right);
 * Câ™¯-note (yellow, lower left);
 * A-note (red, upper right).
 * E-note (green, upper left, an octave lower than blue);
 
Many versions of this game has been released.
In the 2014 version of simon called Simon Swipe, the notes are as follows:
*  G-note (blue, lower right);
*  C-note (yellow, lower left);
*  E-note (red, upper right).
*  G-note (green, upper left, an octave higher than blue)
The swiping sounds are presented with sliding between notes. The bigger the slide, the bigger the swipe will be. The exact notes and sound effects were also used for a smaller version called Simon Micro Series. The sounds were then re-created for Simon Air.
